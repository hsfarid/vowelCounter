JavaScript program that counts the number of vowels in a passed string

- The split() and Array.includes() methods were used in this project.
- An array containing the English vowels were first created
- A count variable was created and initiated with the value 0
- The passed string was splitted into characters using the split() method
- Using the foreEach() method the characters are iterated and compared with array vowels using Array.includes() method in an if function
- If true(character is a vowel) the count variable is incremented by 1
- The count variable(number of values) was then displayed to the browser
